## WP Eloquent

Use Laravel's query builder "Eloquent" in any WordPress plugin.

### What is this plugin?

This plugins is meant to provide a quick start template for anyone who would like to use the Eloquent query builder
(https://github.com/illuminate/database) known from the Laravel framework in a WordPress plugin.

By installing this plugin you can start developing your own WordPress plugin with the use of Eloquent. Of course you
don't have to use this Eloquent to build your queries but if you don't you're probably better off not using this plugin
and just querying with plain SQL.

### Setup

The only package we need for this plugin is `Illuminate Database` (https://github.com/illuminate/database). To install the package run
```
composer install
```
